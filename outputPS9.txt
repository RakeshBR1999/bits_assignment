1. Figure out how many characters in each input value of all the nodes in the tree?

80186356719--->has 11 Characters
Arrogance--->has 9 Characters
Arrogance--->has 9 Characters
arrogance--->has 9 Characters
arrange--->has 7 Characters
Imple1983^4#@--->has 13 Characters
18902678mk362--->has 13 Characters
$we456try--->has 9 Characters
9type21#jr--->has 10 Characters
!9n6lq0@p74jxaal--->has 16 Characters

These are the total 10 nodes in the tree with character count of each node as above

2. Identify how many nodes in the tree are with the same string count and mention those words under the relevant count list.

There are 4 nodes with same string count as 9
['Arrogance', 'Arrogance', 'arrogance', '$we456try']--->9

There are 2 nodes with same string count as 13
['Imple1983^4#@', '18902678mk362']--->13

3. List out all the given input words based on the order of priority as mentioned in the problem statement from highest to least/least to highest.

List of input word based on the order of Priority(higest to least)

$we456try
!9n6lq0@p74jxaal
9type21#jr
80186356719
18902678mk362
Imple1983^4#@
Arrogance
Arrogance
arrogance
arrange


4. Find out the largest string count and the duplicate string after comparing all the nodes in the tree and those nodes position/level in the binary search tree.

Largest string in all the nodes is with 16 as string count and it is at level 3 in the BST..!

Duplicate input string in all the nodes is/are 

Arrogance node repeated for 2 times is at level  1 in the BST..!


5. Specify all the node input values in the preorder traversal of BST.

Preorder traversal of the BST is

80186356719
Arrogance
Arrogance
arrogance
arrange
Imple1983^4#@
18902678mk362
$we456try
9type21#jr
!9n6lq0@p74jxaal
